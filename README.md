Then (found [here](games)) it was assigned the addition of:
+ The **Battleship game**, with 2 modes:
    - Player vs. Computer
    - Player vs. player
+ The **saves feature**, allowing players to interrupt and quit the program (`Ctrl + C`), and the option to continue a previous game the next time they run it.
